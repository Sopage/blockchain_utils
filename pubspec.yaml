  # # To add assets to your package, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - assets/chinese_simplified.txt
  #   - assets/chinese_traditional.txt
  #   - assets/czech.txt
  #   - assets/english.txt
  #   - assets/french.txt
  #   - assets/italian.txt
  #   - assets/japanese.txt
  #   - assets/korean.txt
  #   - assets/portuguese.txt
  #   - assets/spanish.txt
  #
  # For details regarding assets in packages, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  #
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # To add custom fonts to your package, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
